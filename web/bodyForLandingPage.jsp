                    <h2 id="continueReading">How To Choose The Best Car Insurance Company In India?<br></h2><p>The definition of the best car/vehicle insurance company is subjective as it varies from individual to individual depending on their requirements. For some individuals, a car insurance company that has the highest claim settlement ratio is the best, while for others the <a href="#">insurance company</a> which has a wide network of <a href="#">cashless garages</a> is the best. Thus, there are a number of parameters that make an insurance company the best for an individual. One should consider the following factors while choosing a car insurance company.
                    </p><p><strong>1. Network of Cashless Garages</strong>
                    </p><p>There are a number of garages with which a car insurance company partners for the facilitation of cashless insurance claims. While choosing a car insurance company, one must check the strength of the network of cashless garages of the insurance company. One must also see if there are enough cashless garages in the vicinity of his/her locality.
                    </p><p><strong>2. Claim Settlement Ratio</strong>
                    </p><p>Claim Settlement Ratio tells the number of claims settled by a car insurance company out of all the claims received by it during a financial year. It is always good to go with an insurance company with a high <a href="#">claim settlement ratio</a>.
                    </p><p><strong>3. Availability of Add-ons</strong>
                    </p><p>Add-ons refer to extra coverages that can be opted with a standard car insurance policy to extend the coverage. Add-ons are available with own-damage and <a href="#">comprehensive car insurance</a> and can be opted for at the time of policy purchase as well as renewal.
                    </p><p><strong>4. Customer Support Service</strong>
                    </p><p>One must also check the availability and quality of the customer support service offered by an insurance company. While some insurance companies offers 24*7 customer support, some offer 5-day customer assistance services.
                    </p><h3></h3><h2 id="buyInsurancePolicy">Buy Best Car Insurance Policy Online With InsuranceBuddy</h2><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Visit <a href="#">InsuranceBuddy</a> and click on the ?car? tab.

After selecting that, a pop up will open asking you your car?s brand name, model, fuel type, variant, registration year, registration city and RTO.
                    </p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Fill in your personal details like your Name and Mobile Number and click on the ?Submit and Get Quotes? button. Confirm the expiry date of your previous car insurance policy and the name of your previous car insurer.
                    </p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: All available premium quotes will be displayed to you. You can compare and select the quote which best meets your requirements. You can also opt for add-on covers at this stage to extend the coverage of your basic car insurance plan.
                    </p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Enter your personal details, nominee details and car/vehicle details. Proceed with the payment using your credit/debit card or other net banking facilities.

                    </p><h3></h3><h2 id="carInsurancePlans">Types of Car Insurance Plans Offered By Different Insurance Companies</h2><p>On the basis of car/vehicle/4 wheeler insurance coverage, there are three types of car insurance plans:
                    </p><h3>1. Third Party Car Insurance</h3><p>According to Indian Motor Tariff, every car owner in the country is mandated to have at least a third-party car insurance policy. This plan provides you coverage for all third party liabilities such as third party bodily injuries, disability, death as well as property damage which may occur due to any unfortunate event involving your car. The third party property damage is limited to Rs. 7.5 lakh under this plan.
                    </p><h3>2.Standalone Own-Damage Car Insurance</h3><p>This plan provides coverage only for own-damages incurred by your car in any mishap such as road accident, natural calamity, fire, explosion, theft, riot, etc. To remain compliant with the legal requirements, you must purchase a third party car insurance plan with it. A <a href="#">standalone own-damage car insurance</a> plan gives you the flexibility to choose your own-damage cover and third party cover from different insurance companies.
                    </p><h3>3. Comprehensive Car Insurance</h3><p>This is a bundled cover that offers you coverage for both third-party liabilities as well as own damages incurred by your car in an unfortunate event. Among all the three types of car insurance plans, a <a href="#">comprehensive cover</a> offers you the maximum coverage. You can further extend the coverage of this plan by opting for add-ons like zero depreciation cover, engine cover, etc.
